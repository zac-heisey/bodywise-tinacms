Whether you’re a weekend warrior or a serious athlete, sports injuries are a fact of life. A twisted ankle or an aching back can usually be treated at home. But for those breaks and tears that call for immediate medical attention, or those pains that just aren’t going away, [physical therapy](/) is often a critical part of the healing process.

## COMMON SPORTS INJURIES

Whether it’s an immediate, dramatic break or damage that accumulates over time, sports can do some serious damage. The workout-related problems we frequently treat include:

Repetitive stress conditions. Arthritis and tendonitis often stem from sports moves like swinging a racket or throwing a ball. Joints and muscles can become inflamed in vulnerable areas, including shoulders, elbows, hips, ankles and knees.

Torn tendons and ligaments. Those dramatic jumps, twists and stretches can result in equally dramatic “snapped” tissues, especially in the knees, shoulders and groin. Surgery followed by physical therapy is often the prescription.

Strained back. Sometimes that sore lower back pain just won’t go away with basic home care. In such cases, we’ll work with you to rebuild strength and flexibility.

Fractures and breaks. When you have a bone injury during a game or workout, a trip to the emergency room usually results in a cast to promote healing. But as your bone is recovering, the muscles around it are weakening. Physical therapy helps to strengthen the affected area following a fracture.

**Rehab Therapy**

Some sports injuries require surgery or other medical procedures as the first line of defense. In fact, postoperative physical therapy is key to transitioning back to normalcy. Similarly, when your injury requires a cast or some form of bracing, our team of physical therapists will help you rebound from the diminished strength and range of movement that happens while the limb is out of commission.

**Prevention**

Athletes know that the best way to avoid injury or re-injury is to build up strength and flexibility. Working out at the gym is great, but our physical therapists will guide you through specific moves that help you avoid future injuries based on your sport and your specific build. We’ll also talk you through strategies you can implement when you’re back on the field.
