It may come as a surprise, but diet and nutrition are key components to conditions managed by physical therapy. Maintaining a balanced diet can directly affect the body’s physical function and promote faster recovery times.

A diet can encourage healing by giving your body the building blocks it needs to repair damaged tissue and provide the nutrients to build new, healthy tissue. When your body does not get the nutritional components it needs on a daily basis, it is left without the necessities to function properly, and recovery times increase. Complications of a poor diet that can negatively affect your condition being in Physical Therapy include things like widespread inflammation, obesity, and disease.

  
Building a nutritional plan is not within a physical therapist scope of practice, but it is important to understand the ways that diet can affect musculoskeletal conditions in order to help you get back to doing the things to love. The key of an ideal recovery diet? Focus on anti-inflammatory foods, eliminate those foods that increase inflammation all the while keeping those essential nutrients and minerals in play.

THINGS YOU WANT TO AVOID
