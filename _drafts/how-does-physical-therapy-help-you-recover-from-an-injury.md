Have you recently experienced an injury and your body is not recovering the way you would expect it to with time? Or maybe you are [preparing for surgery](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/slideshows/10-ways-to-prepare-for-surgery) and know you have some physical therapy coming in your future.

Are you wondering what exactly happens at physical therapy? If you're in pain you might be wondering, does physical therapy help?

Read on to learn about the role of physical therapy in your recovery from surgery, illness or injury.

## Reasons to See a Physical Therapist

There are many benefits to sessions with a physical therapist. A [good physical therapist](https://bodywisept.com/10-key-things-to-consider-as-you-try-to-find-a-physical-therapist/) will help you to rehabilitate yourself. They will work to improve your activity level, strength, and range of motion.

Doctors will send patients to physical therapy for a number of reasons. These might include:

* Avoiding surgery
* Recovery from surgery
* Recovery from injury
* Pain management
* Age-related issues
* Improve balance and mobility

Physical therapists work with you one on one to restore your body to normal function. Let's take a look at some of the things a PT does to help get your body in good working order.

## Pain Management

Many want to turn to medication for [pain management](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/8-non-invasive-pain-relief-techniques-that-really-work). The truth is there are many [alternatives for pain management](https://bodywisept.com/the-medication-free-way-to-deal-with-pain/) and physical therapists work on those.

If you are having pain as a result of illness, injury, or surgery, the physical therapist is going to pinpoint the body part causing the pain.

They will decide if the pain is a direct result of your injury or illness or a by-product of it. They will use soft tissue and joint mobilization, ice, heat, ultrasound, taping, or electrical stimulation to relieve pain symptoms.

## Stretching Muscles and Joints

[Stretching muscles](https://bodywisept.com/stretching-the-truth-discussing-4-common-misconceptions-about-stretching/) and joints is at the core of what the physical therapist does.

The PT will stretch muscles to restore flexibility. The stretching also improves the range of motion in joints.

If you have had surgery or an injury, scar tissue can form and build up, preventing proper healing. Their work on soft tissues helps to prevent scar tissue from forming and impacting recovery.

## Core Strength Training

When you think about your body, imagine it as a house. The [core of your body](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/core-exercises/art-20044751) (the pelvis, lower back, hips, and abdomen) are your body's foundation. Just like a house foundation, you will be sturdier if they are in good working order.

You might go to physical therapy for an ankle injury and still work on core strength training as it is instrumental for your balance and stability.

Strengthening your core muscles helps to prevent other chronic injuries. In essence, it makes the "foundation" of your body stronger.

## Improving Stability and Mobility

In addition to working on your core, the physical therapist will work to improve your mobility. If you have difficulty walking, standing, maintaining your balance, or moving around, physical therapy can address it.

Even patients using assistive devices like canes and walkers can improve mobility with physical therapy. First, the physical therapist will make sure you are using those devices correctly.

Even a wheelchair-bound patient can improve mobility just by how they function in their chair.

The physical therapist can evaluate your stability and mobility and work to strengthen the body so you are able to improve and maximize your mobility.

## Exercises to Stabilize the Body

The physical therapist will also focus on the body part experiencing injury or recovery. Again, say you've injured an ankle and had surgery. Once the doctor gives clearance, the PT can start to work on the ankle, foot and all associated muscles, joints, and tissues.

They will set up an exercise regimen that is appropriate for your recovery. You might be thinking "How can I exercise if I can't even stand?" Well, the exercises will target specific muscles and joints to strengthen them.

As you gain strength and improve, the exercise plan adjusts. PT's plan of exercise should help to aid in recovery and strengthen muscles over time.

## Ice and Heat Management

The doctor might have said, "Make sure you put some ice on that injury." This is good advice to follow.

Ice and heat therapy is part of the PT regiment to manage pain, swelling, and stimulate the blood flow in the area.

Heating up the muscles helps them move better and cooling them off helps to reduce swelling and manage pain so they can continue to recover.

Physical therapists are trained to know when is the right time to heat and to use ice. They can even make this part of your at-home recovery plan.

## Ultrasound

Certainly, you have heard of pregnant women having an ultrasound. Did you know that physical therapists also use ultrasound as part of their therapy?

Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves that go into the specific body area. In physical therapy, they are used to stimulate deep tissues.

The deep tissues experience the sound waves coming into them, it warms those tissues, increasing blood flow to the area. This, in turn, helps to stimulate healing.

## Electrical Stimulation

Electrical stimulation is used much the same way ultrasound is used. Often nerves are impacted in the area of an injury or after surgery. The electrical stimulation is used by the physical therapist to increase blood flow to an area that helps with the healing process.

Electrical stimulation is also a pain management technique too.
