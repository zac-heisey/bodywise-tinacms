As of 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 52.5 million Americans over the age of 18 have a diagnosis of arthritis. This is estimated to be around 63 million today and projected to be 78 million by the year 2040. Nearly half of all adults over the age of 65 have been diagnosed and 1/3 of those ages 45 to 65.

### What exactly IS arthritis?

Arthritis is swelling and tenderness in one or more joints. There are more than 100 arthritic conditions that affect the joints, tissues around the joints and connective tissues but the most commonly diagnosed and more well known include rheumatoid, gout, psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia and of course; osteoarthritis (OA).

With osteoarthritis, the cartilage (a stiff yet still flexible tissue on the ends of bones that allows joints to move fluidly) breaks down over time and causes the underlying bones to begin to change and degrade. As you can imagine, this can be quite painful and can cause joint stiffness leading to decreased mobility and function.

While OA can occur in any joint in the body, it is most commonly diagnosed in the hips, knees and hands. There are a number of medications, splints and braces, and potential surgeries that can be helpful in more extreme cases but physical activity and appropriate exercise is the quickest and easiest way to help ease your pain and keep you healthy and active!

YOU can delay the progression of osteoarthritis! Here are some simple tips to guide your exercise program at home but make sure you visit your physical therapy team here at Bodywise to fully access your specific situation and direct your personalized exercise program.

### **LOW IMPACT CARDIO TRAINING**

A great way to move many joints at once in a smooth, coordinated fashion providing lubrication to the joints. Some examples include:

* Swimming
* Water aerobics
* Elliptical training
* Recumbent cycling

### **STRETCHING**

##### Quadricep stretch

* While in a standing position, bend one knee back behind and hold your ankle/foot.
* Next, gently pull your knee into a more bent position until a stretch is felt on the front of the thigh.

##### **Hamstring stretch**

* While seated, rest your heel on the floor with your knee straight and gently lean forward until a stretch is felt behind your knee/thigh.

##### **Figure four/Glute stretch**

* While lying on your back with both knee bent, cross one leg on the other knee.
* Next, grab hold your grounded thigh and pull it up towards your chest until a stretch is felt in the buttock.

### STRENGHTINING

##### **Straight Leg Raise**

* Lying on a firm surface, tighten muscle on top of thigh to lock knee straight.
* Lift leg to height of uninvolved leg as pictured.

##### Bridge

* While lying on your back with knees bent, tighten your lower abdominals, squeeze your buttocks and then raise your buttocks off the floor/bed as creating a "Bridge" with your body.
* Hold and then lower yourself and repeat.

##### 

##### Clam

* While lying on your side with your knees bent to about 60 degrees, draw up the top knee while keeping your feet together.
* Do not let your pelvis roll back during the lifting movement.

##### Sit to stand

* Start by scooting close to the front of the chair. Next, lean forward at your trunk and reach forward with your arms and rise to standing without using your hands to push off from the chair or other object.
* Keep your weight back on your heels
* Use your arms as a counter-balance by reaching forward when in sitting and lower them as you approach standing.
