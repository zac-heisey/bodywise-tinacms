**Physical Therapy isn't always only exercises and stretches, sometimes your therapist will use speciality techniques like Graston to help with your condition.** 

Graston fundamentally is simple, it is a form of instrumented assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM).

And instrumented assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) is just that: soft tissue mobilization assisted with an instrument rather than the hands alone. The indications for this treatment modality are similar to that of any soft tissue technique but the effects can be more pronounced and reached more efficiently with these specialized instruments in the hands of a skilled therapist. The use of these instruments differentiate this technique form massage and can have more of an effect in certain cases. 

Graston can be used to treat a variety of different tissue types including tendon, muscle, and ligament and the technique can be modified appropriately to address tissues in all different stages of healing from the acute inflammatory stage to the maturation stage. Graston tools allow the provider to detect and amplify the feeling of soft tissue restriction, similar to how a stethoscope amplifies the sound of a heart beat and then simultaneously allows the provider to treat the identified area of restriction in the same session.

Graston is indicated to treat a wide range of ailments from tendinopathies (ie tennis elbow, patellar tendinosis, or achilles tendinosis), to fascial syndromes (ie plantar fasciitis or trigger finger), ligamentous pain (ie MCL/LCL sprain, AC ligament sprain), scar tissue/adhesion, entrapment syndromes (ie carpal tunnel or thoracic outlet syndrome), and edema reduction.

The physiologic effects of the Graston technique include:

* Increased Fibroblast activity (cells that secrete collagen and play a critical role in wound healing)
* Increased blood perfusion, bringing nutrients, oxygen and fibroblasts
* Mechanically mobilize scar tissue: increasing the pliability and loosening the scar from surrounding healthy tissues
* Reinitiate the inflammatory process by introducing small amount of trauma which starts the healing process again
* Increased fascial mobility by breaking cross-fiber links and splaying fibers
* Mechanotransduction: the load from the Graston technique stimulates tissue repair and remodeling
* Increased circulating stem cells

Graston technique can be a great addition to your treatment plan when applied appropriately and integrated efficiently with stretching and neuromuscular re-education and can help you get back on your feet and moving in the right direction!
