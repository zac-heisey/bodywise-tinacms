Hip problems are inconvenient and debilitating without proper medical treatment. For millions of Americans, physical therapy for hip pain is the best option.

If someone is experiencing pain in the hip, there's a good chance other problems can develop in the knees, legs, back, or neck.

Physical therapy for your hip will reduce the pain and mitigate the risk of further damage or injury. Here's what you need to know to better understand physical therapy.

## How Does Physical Therapy for Hip Pain Help?

Physical therapy should be a personalized treatment developed by a trained and educated physical therapist (PT).

The PT is going to examine and test your functionality, mobility, and range to figure out what you can do for treatment.

Your strength, balance, and regular movements will be checked to help regulate your current abilities.

Physical therapy will be more than exercise and stretching. A medical professional will also recommend devices meant to improve your quality of life such as orthotics.

## Identify the Pain

The hip pain you're experiencing might not actually be originating in your hips. The lower back is the most common culprit for hip discomfort.

These are some symptoms you can use to identify the source of your pain.

### Pain on the Side

If you're feeling pain on the side of your hip, then it's usually an indication of problems with your bursa sac causing discomfort.

The [bursa sac](https://www.medicinenet.com/hip_bursitis/article.htm) helps your muscles and bones smoothly move past each other. If you've been using your hips in repetitive motions, the bursa sac might have become aggravated.

This condition is commonly called bursitis.

### Pain in the Front

Pain in your groin or towards the front of the hip is usually a sign of arthritis. It can also be that your hip ball and socket joints are pinching each other.

If you've been doing excessive exercise, you may also have a strain of the muscles around the hips.

### Pain in the Back

Do you have persistent pain in the back of your hips or buttocks? You might actually have a [lower back issue](https://bodywisept.com/low-back-pain-sciatica/) instead of a hip issue.

You can test yourself by standing straight with your feet apart. Bend at the waist and let your lower back bend, too. Straighten back to the original position.

If your pain increases while bending, your issue is more than likely centered on your back instead of your hips.

## The First Physical Therapy Session

Your first session will be an evaluation. Earlier, it is mentioned that they will put you through a string of tests.

Here is a more in-depth list of what you'll do.

- **Palpitation** - a physical therapist will want to see if there areas near the hips that are painful to the touch
- **Walking evaluation** - you will be asked to walk normally to spot any issues
- **Range of motion** - they will test your ability to bend or rotate to assist with a treatment plan
- **Strength** - your pain may be caused by a lack of development or imbalance in the muscles
- **Functional** - if your pain isn't too severe, a PT will ask you to run or climb at a normal pace to watch your movements

For those who are athletes or require specific movements for work, you may be required to fulfill special tests outside the normal scope of an average person.

After the tests, a PT will have an excellent idea of what to put in your treatment plan. Besides movements, stretching, exercise, you may be required to frequently use heat and ice to help ease the pain.

Most PTs strongly recommend continuing any exercises or inflammation control to be completed at home as well as at physical therapy sessions.

### Advanced Options

Patients who have more extensive injuries or genetic diseases probably need more advanced treatment.

[Electrical stimulation](https://arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/managing-pain/pain-relief-solutions/electrical-nerve-stimulation-for-arthritis-pain) can become a part of the treatment plan if your muscles are the source of your pain.

If your expected recovery is long-term, your focus should be on the quality of life while you rehab. Ask your PT about the possibility of using orthotics or other assistive measures to make life comfortable.

Properly practicing your treatment plan can ward off surgery or other health risks.

## Surgery Time

Injuries that are mechanical in nature as opposed to inflammatory can be addressed quicker with surgery.

Most athletes and workers who have physically intensive jobs would rather have surgery upfront to fix the issue so they can return to work.

Patients with [severe osteoarthritis](https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/osteoarthritis.htm) may opt for a hip replacement to instantly eliminate the pain.

People involved in car accidents are always urged to seek medical assistance even if they feel fine. At the time of the accident, your adrenaline is going strong to ward off soreness or pain.

Get checked by your physician to see if you'll need surgery down the line. Often there are signs of injury in your hips due to your position seated.

Even if you decide surgery is going to be the best path, you'll probably still have some form of physical therapy after the procedure.

The physical rehab they have you do will make your recovery quicker and easier. Knowing what you need to do to improve your health at home is the key to a fast recovery.

## Insurance

The cost of outpatient rehabilitation with a PT is almost always covered by insurance carriers including Medicaid and Medicare.

Always check with your provider first.

Whether it's your primary care physician or the surgeon who performed on your hip, you will need a prescription of physical therapy written by a doctor.

Providing this prescription will be the key to making sure your insurance covers the bill.
