As your surgery nears, getting through the operation itself is probably all that’s on your mind. But once you’ve successfully cleared that hurdle, you may find that the real work is about to begin. No matter how much of a miracle worker your surgeon is, that skillful work can be undone without proper post-surgical rehabilitation.

The two main areas of concern for anyone after an operation are loss of strength and loss of mobility. Our [physical therapists](/our-staff/) work on these muscle and joint issues so that not only are the specific areas on which you were operated on given plenty of attention — but your overall endurance and flexibility will also be improved. This comprehensive approach to physical therapy after an operation allows you to bounce back more quickly.

**Which Operations Should Be Followed by Physical Therapy?**

Of course, not every post-surgical period can be improved upon with physical therapy. But in many cases, this type of rehab speeds up the recovery process. Here are a few operations for which physical therapy is usually recommended as a follow up:

- Rotator cuff tear repair
- Hip, shoulder and knee joint replacements
- Ligament tears in the knee (ACL, LCL, MCL, and PCL)
- Arthroscopy and meniscus repair
- Spinal surgery
- Additional operations resulting in weakness or stiffness

**How Does Post-Surgical Rehab Speed Recovery?**

Operations such as joint replacements and spinal surgeries can result in mild to extreme discomfort. Our dedicated team of physical therapists can help reduce this pain in a number of ways, from applying ice, gentle massage or low-pulse electrical devices, to gently manipulating your muscles to ease tension.

Once your pain is under control, [physical therapy](/) can begin to address the challenges of your specific surgery. If you had a knee replacement or ligament repair work, for example, moves that strengthen your knees will be part of your recovery.

Of course, being laid up can affect your body in ways that extend beyond the area of surgery. You might lose muscle mass or even develop breathing problems, in some instances. Your physical therapist will work with you to rebuild your strength and endurance, while also working the specific surgical areas.

**Ready for Your Consultation?**

Whether you’re planning ahead or don’t know until after your surgery that you’ll need additional help getting back on your feet, call our office as soon as possible. We’ll help evaluate your post-surgical rehabilitation areas of focus, and talk you through when you can expect to be back to your normal routine!
