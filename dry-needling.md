## What is Dry Needling?

Dry Needling is a medical technique performed by a skilled physical therapist to immediately reduce pain, muscle tension and improve mobility. It is used in a variety of musculoskeletal problems including, but not limited to: acute or chronic injuries, [headaches](/headaches-tmj/), [neck pain](/neck-pain-whiplash/), [back pain](/low-back-pain-sciatica/), [tendinitis](/tendonitis/), muscle spasms, sciatica, hip or [knee pain](/knee-pain/), muscle strains, fibromyalgia, tennis or golfer’s elbow, overuse injuries, and much more.

Several of our therapists are certified in Dry Needling. Dry Needling can be a very effective medical treatment, which uses a very thin needle to achieve its function. This is not the same as acupuncture, an aspect of traditional Chinese medicine, which is based on the metaphysical theory of normalizing energy flow in the body.

**Dry Needling is a western medical technique that is based on scientific studies and knowledge.**

- Dry Needling involves placing a thin and flexible monofilament (solid) needle into a muscle or muscles to release shortened bands of muscle, known as trigger points.
- Helps to resolve pain and muscle tension, which will promote healing, flexibility, and strength.
- Increases blood flow to injured tissue and helps to remodel painful scar tissue.

It is important to view Dry Needling as one aspect of your rehabilitation plan of care. Dry Needling is not a miracle cure, and it is vital to perform the other aspects of physical therapy along with Dry Needling. This may include tissue mobilization, stretching, strengthening, and functional conditioning.

**Is this Acupuncture?**

There are many similarities and differences between dry needling and acupuncture. Licensed physical therapists in a growing number of states can use dry needling under the scope of their practice. Our [physical therapists](/our-staff/) are not licensed acupuncturists and do not practice acupuncture. In contrast to most schools of acupuncture, dry needling is strictly based on Western medicine principles and research.

**What can be treated by Dry Needling?**

Dry Needling can be used for a variety of musculoskeletal problems. When combined with traditional physical therapy and the advanced manual therapy techniques, we have had success treating most pain-related problems from head to toe and from acute to chronic conditions.

Also Dry Needling can be used to help athletes overcome delayed onset muscle soreness. As athletes push the envelope to become bigger and faster or to reach new goals, recovery becomes an essential phase in the process. Often times dry needling can be used to speed up this recovery time and allow the athlete to return to training or to playing as soon as possible.

**Is Dry Needling Painful?**

For most people, there is little to no discomfort with the insertion of the needle.  We strive to make the treatment virtually painless, however, at times, you may experience a “twitch response” which often feels like a quick muscle cramp or ache. These sensations are normal and even desirable at times.  Following this technique muscle soreness can be felt up to 24-48 hours. The application of heat or ice and drinking plenty of fluids usually reduces the soreness.

Dry Needling is a powerful treatment technique that when used in conjunction with our other physical therapy treatments, can help you relieve your pain and improve your function quickly.
