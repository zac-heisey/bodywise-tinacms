## What is IASTM?

Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) is a manual technique that uses a tool with an edge. Your therapist can perform IASTM using a variety of pressures and speeds to help break up adhesions, stimulate healing, and facilitate a contraction (turn a muscle on), or inhibit a muscle (turn a muscle off).

### How Does It Work?

Instruments effectively break down fascial restrictions and scar tissue. (Fascia is a fancy word for connective tissue that goes all over the body). The design of these instruments provides the therapist with the ability to find damaged areas and allows the therapist to treat the area with the appropriate amount of pressure.

The introduction of controlled small tissue damage to the affected muscles, tendons and/or ligaments causes a mild inflammatory response. This starts the natural process of healing.  Adhesions(scars) within the tissues which may have developed as a result of surgery, immobilization, repeated strain or other mechanisms, are broken down allowing full functional restoration to occur.
