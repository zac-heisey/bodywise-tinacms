Martina Young is a Doctor of Physical Therapy, an avid athlete, a triathlon coach and a mother of two beautiful girls. She stands for quality care and long-term results. Martina believes that absolutely anyone has the ability to move effortlessly.

During her years of practice, Martina had the amazing opportunity to treat professional and Olympic-level athletes. Treating athletes, then seeing them return to such a high level of competition (the kind that made her hair stand up!) was one of the biggest honors of her career. She has many stories about patients who thought it impossible to fight through chronic pain in order to heal, but she was able to show them the way. "Getting to the source of the problem is the key component of a successful rehabilitation plan," says Martina. In the PT room, she prides herself in being a 'good detective.'

Martina's training includes courses in: Therapeutic and Functional Dry Needling, Selective Functional Movement Analysis with Corrective Exercise, Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Reeducation and Functional Mobilization.
