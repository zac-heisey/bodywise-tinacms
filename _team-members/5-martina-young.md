My name is Martina Young and I am a Doctor of Physical Therapy, an avid athlete, a triathlon coach and a mother of two beautiful girls. I stand for quality care and long-term results. I believe that anyone can move effortlessly.

During my years of practice Iâ€™ve had the privilege of treating professional and Olympic athletes. Helping them return to the level of competition that makes our hair stand as we watch them do their craft, was an honor. I can also tell you about patients who could once again start enjoying activities they considered impossible due to perpetual pain. Getting to the source of the problem is the key component of a successful rehabilitation plan and I pride myself in being a good detective.

My training includes courses such as Therapeutic and Functional Dry Needling, Selective Functional Movement Analysis with Corrective Exercise, Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Reeducation and Functional Mobilization.
