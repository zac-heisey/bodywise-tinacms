Your knees: they’re one of the largest joints in your body, connecting a large number of muscles, bones and ligaments. That means that much of the daily abuse that your body takes can ultimately impact your knees. And when these crucial joints begin to show strain, it can become difficult to move much at all — at least without pain.

For that reason, it’s important to seek medical attention for knee pain as soon as possible. Often, [physical therapy](/) can be the key to avoiding surgery or prescription medication altogether or rebounding quickly from those less conservative treatments.

## WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT KNEE PAIN?

Knee pain has many causes, including arthritis and bursitis. In addition, sports injuries such as tearing your anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can lead to severe knee pain, as can suddenly twisting your knee and tearing your meniscus. “Loose body” is another knee pain cause; this involves bone or cartilage coming loose and getting in the way of joint movement. Finally, it’s not uncommon for a hip or foot problem to throw your knees out of alignment.

Our highly trained team of physical therapists will evaluate your knee issues, including the location and level of pain and how far you can bend and move your knees and legs in various positions. In all likelihood, your physical therapy to decrease knee pain will consist of strength-building movements, as well as stretches and other flexibility-enhancing techniques.
