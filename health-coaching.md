### **WHAT IS HEALTH COACHING?**

It's so much more than food!  Most of us know we should "eat better" and "exercise more," but what does that really mean?  How do you do it? How do you break bad habits and build new, sustainable routines?  This is where health coaching comes in.  We will help you bridge the gap between the desire to be healthy and actually getting healthy!  There is no one size fits all program and your coach will provide the tools and skills to build new habits and make lasting changes.
